                    Little Chefs is a website where kids teach kids to cook. Our main goals are to foster peer-to-peer
                    learning, healthy eating,
                    and teaching children life skills.

                    The roots of Little Chefs begin in the late 1980's on the set of a National Geographic shoot for a
                    film introducing the
                    new food pyramid to school kids. The consultants thought that a pizza with vegetables, meat and
                    cheese would be in line
                    with the recommendations of the food pyramid, and would be something a kid might want to eat. The
                    idea was sparked when
                    after the shoot was finished, the young, eight year old actor who had just completed making the
                    pizza turned to me and said,
                    "I had no idea pizza didn't come out of a box". That's when the light bulb sparked and she realised
                    that kids kids didnâ€™t
                    know where their food came from. It seems impossible today when 10 year old chefs are competing
                    against professionals on
                    television but that was a time when the market was still being dominated by fast food and
                    convenience food for children.

                    The writing style of Little Chefs was designed for latch-key kids. So while writing recipes, I went
                    to great
                    lengths to make sure a child working alone could figure out what to do. Additionally, I wanted to
                    counter the culture of
                    childrens cookbooks utilizing sweets and junk food to appeal to their audience by using healthy and
                    family
                    friendly recipes.</p>
